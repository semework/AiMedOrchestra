Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic disorders characterized by high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form and is largely the result of excess body weight and physical inactivity. Management focuses on diet, exercise, and medications that lower blood glucose levels. Recent studies have shown promising results using SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists.
